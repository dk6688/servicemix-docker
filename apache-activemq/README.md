# Apache ActiveMQ

ActiveMQ comes in three "flavors" -

1. Apache ActiveMQ (classic)
2. Apache ActiveMQ Apollo (rewrite of ActiveMQ core for improved scalability)
3. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis (the merging of ActiveMQ and HornetQ)

Some things to be aware of:

- The official Artemis roadmap notes that the ultimate goal is for
  ["Artemis to eventually become ActiveMQ 6.x."](
  http://activemq.apache.org/activemq-artemis-roadmap.html)
- Apollo [has not seen a release since mid-2015](
  https://github.com/apache/activemq-apollo/releases).
- Apollo's primary author has stated explicitly that he
  [has "stopped working on apollo"](
  http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Future-of-Apollo-td4694644.html)
- Apollo [appears to **not** be OSGi-enabled](
