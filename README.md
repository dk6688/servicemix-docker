# Apache ServiceMix Docker profile

The subfolders of this project contain *Dockerfile*s and other build-
and run-time assets that can be used to create Docker images for
[Apache ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/) and its related
components.

Combinations of these images may be used to experiment with various
ServiceMix topologies.

**At this time, the Docker images that result from building any
_Dockerfile_ in or referenced by this project are _NOT FOR
DEPLOYMENT INTO ANY NON-LOCAL ENVIRONMENT!_ They are intended for
local development/educational use _only_.**

This project is a work-in-progress. The ultimate goal is to have a
collection of *Dockerfiles* that I can use as a foundation to create
any Apache ServiceMix topology that I need for development and/or
deployment. If anyone else finds this profile useful, all the better.
